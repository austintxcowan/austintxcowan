    <td>I have known Austin Cowan for many years, through several life cycles. He was amazing as a digital marketing consultant for BDX. He was so great at building new relationships and nurturing clients to close and beyond. His unique curiosity and interest in others (it is genuine!) builds instant rapport, and then his follow up is impeccable. I would hire him in an instant if I had an opening! A true naturally talented gem....</td>

    <td>BDX - Builders Digital Experience, LLC</td>    
    <td>Austin is one of the hardest working, easiest to coach, most dedicated and positive people I have ever managed. Fiercely loyal, willing to learn, lead and step in to help other team members. Austin quickly advanced in his role at BDX by exceeding both his revenue goals and new customer base. Austin’s future is very bright and I look forward to watching him soar. </td>

    <td>BDX - Builders Digital Experience, LLC</td>    
    <td>I worked with Austin on an implementation project where he received ever changing direction on a regular basis. He completed these tasks with enthusiasm, was thorough and I appreciated his help. With his move to Sales, he did a great job connecting with his clients and learning a wide breadth of products. He asked good questions and always wanted to learn and achieve more. He is truly a nice human, always smiling, and goes out of his way to organize fun/competitive social events. Austin is missed and whoever hires him, will gain a great team player.</td>

    <td>BDX - Builders Digital Experience, LLC</td>    
    <td>Austin is friendly and always willing to go the extra mile. He isn’t afraid to jump in and help clients find solutions to their digital marketing needs. Austin is eager to learn and not afraid of feedback. He would be a great addition to any team.</td>

  <td>Larry Ward</td>
    <td>Political Media, Inc.</td>    
    <td>Austin is very detailed, reliable and thorough. He is a self starter, never missed deadlines and available when needed. He would be an asset to any company he works with.</td>
   <tr>  
  <td>Eric Clary</td>
    <td>Political Media, Inc.</td>    
    <td>From Austin’s first day till his last he remained a steadfast employee. Whenever he finished a project ahead of schedule he immediately asked for more work. Over the course of year-and-a-half, Austin’s meticulous management and organization won him accolades from both coworkers and clients. We’re happy to see his future open up but he will be missed. </td> 
  <tr>  
  <td>Mychal Williams</td>
    <td>GoDaddy</td>    
    <td>Austin has a no-quit mentality. Sales can be challenging to learn, and most people tend to give up, not Austin. He struggled for a short time but quickly built a reputation of a top-performing rep within his respective division. It's not always how you start, but sometimes how you finish, and Austin finished STRONG at GoDaddy.</td>
  <tr>  
  <td>Brian Brandon</td>
    <td>GoDaddy</td>    
    <td>"This guy never stops" is what I thought to myself when I started working with Austin. I knew I had something special when I was introduced as his manager earlier this year. His previous manager had spoken highly of him; his numbers are stellar; and everyone on the team loved him. With attributes like that you would figure that he'd be a finished product but that wasn't the case. Austin consistently reached out to see how he could get better at the job and how he could help the team. He shared his insights about how the team could get better and followed through with every learning and development opportunity he was given. That includes diving head first into the opportunity to participate in test teams to examine new products and new processes. With his work ethic and openness to coaching, his top 20% ranking in recent months is not a one time visit. He's moving in. I know that any employer would be delighted to hire Austin for what he can accomplish today and they'd be overwhelmed with the elite salesperson he develops into.</td>
  <tr>  
  <td>Dyer Whitt</td>
    <td>GoDaddy</td>    
    <td>As Austin's sales manager, we spent countless hours working together to perfect his messaging, strategy, and sales development. However, I think it was Austin that taught me more than anything. Austin showed me how to put hard work over everything, sell ethically, and to foster a strong culture amongst our team. He is an intuitive leader and team player - my favorite thing about Austin is how well he is able to deliver big-picture insights into any problem you're having. He single-handedly helped turn our team around one month that we were doing poorly. Culture fit, process oriented, and trustworthy with an exceptional character that will level-up your organization.</td>  <tr>
